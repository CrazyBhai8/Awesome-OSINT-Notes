# 3. Fack Identity OSINT

## Building a Sock Puppet Identity for OSINT

### 1\. Creating an Untraceable Covert Account

### 1.1 Sock Puppet Accounts

Sock Puppet is a covert account that is not related to your identity.

This will prevent you from revealing your identity when performing SOCMINT.

### 1.1.2 Create a sock puppet

Virtual Machine: Software emulation of a physical computer.

Features:

- Shares the resources of the host machine.
- Allow you to run multiple operating systems on one computer.

**Set up your VM**  
**Why to use a sock puppet account in a VM?**

- Hide your real OS footprints from websites.(e.g. OS name, timeline, cookei etc)
- Protect your main system from malware.
- Quickly wipe your VM after an investigation is done.

### 1.1.3 Digital Identity / Covert Account

A **digital identity** or **covert account** is an **online persona** created to conceal your real identity during OSINT investigations, red teaming, or social engineering.

#### Key Traits:

- **Unconnected to your personal identity** (no real links to your name, email, or phone).
- Ideally, it should **mirror the target's environment**, language, and behavior to blend in.

## **Creating a Fake Identity**

Use the following tools to generate realistic personas:

### **Fake Name Generator**

- https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/
    
- Generates:
    
    - Full name
    - Address
    - Email
    - Phone number
    - SSN (for US profiles)
    - Credit card info
- Useful for creating detailed and believable online profiles.
    

### **AI-Generated Profile Pictures**

- https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
- https://thispersonnotexist.org/
- These tools generate **AI-generated human faces** that do **not exist in real life**.
- Use them as profile pictures for fake social media or forums.

## ⚠️ Harpy’s Tip:

> Never reuse real images or identities. Always **compartmentalize your covert accounts**, use **virtual machines** or **isolated browsers**, and connect through **VPN or Tor** for maximum OPSEC.

## 2\. How to Keep Your Covert Account Safe & Active

Creating a covert identity is only the beginning. To avoid detection and keep the persona believable, you must maintain **operational security (OPSEC)** and **behavioral consistency**.

### **Checklist to Keep It Safe & Alive**

1.  Use a **virtual machine** or **dedicated browser** (isolated from your real identity).
2.  Create a **complete fake identity** using fake name generators.
3.  Set up a **Fastmail** email account.
4.  Get a **burner phone number** (temporary SIM).
5.  Connect through **public Wi-Fi** (like in libraries or cafes).
6.  Create **social media accounts** (Facebook, Instagram, X, etc.).
7.  Keep the accounts **active** (post content, follow users, comment).
8.  **Log in at least twice a week** to avoid account flagging or removal.

### **Create a Fastmail Email**

- Visit: https://www.fastmail.com/
- Sign up with your puppet identity details (name, fake DOB, etc.)
- Use “Try for Free” to test the setup.

> ⚠️ Fastmail may ask for **phone number verification**. Skip this for now — see next step.

### **Get a Burner Number**

#### If you're in the **USA**:

- Buy a temporary SIM card like:  
    [Mint Mobile Prepaid SIM - BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/mint-mobile-prepaid-sim-card-starter-kit-gold/6310601.p)

#### If you're in a **European country**:

- Use: https://www.lebara.nl/en/home.html  
    (Lebara offers cheap, prepaid SIM cards usable for verification)

> Burner numbers are essential for verifying accounts like Facebook or email without using your real phone.

### **Use a Library or Café Wi-Fi**

> Public Wi-Fi is better than VPN in some cases because:

- Sites like Facebook can detect and flag **VPN or proxy connections** as suspicious.
- Library or café Wi-Fi helps maintain a **natural login pattern**.

### **Keep the Account Active**

- Add a few friends or follow relevant accounts (based on your persona).
- Post believable content (quotes, selfies from AI-generated images, memes).
- Like, share, and comment occasionally.
- Avoid doing **nothing** — that’s a red flag for algorithms.

### **Login Frequency & Security**

- **Log in at least twice a week** to keep the account in good standing.
    
- Set up **2-Factor Authentication (2FA)** using:
    
    - Authenticator app (not linked to your real number)
    - Burner phone for SMS-based 2FA (only if needed)
