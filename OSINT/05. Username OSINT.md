## 5. Username OSINT

### 1.1 Tracking a Username Using Advanced Search Techniques

**Step 1: Gather Online Usernames**  
After collecting info on your target, save all found usernames in a text file for future searches.  
Example:

```
user-name
_Username420
un132
user-name_
```

**Step 2: Search Operators**  
Use search operators to see if a username is indexed by search engines.

**Format:**

```plaintext
inurl:username1 OR inurl:username2 OR inurl:username3
```

**Purpose**: Helps you uncover accounts on other platforms like Quora, Cloudflare, Pinterest, Medium, etc.

## **1.2 Finding Hidden Profiles with Reverse Username Lookup**

### **People Search Engines**

One powerful tool for reverse username lookups is **ID Crawl**.

**Website:** https://www.idcrawl.com/

**How to Use ID Crawl:**

1.  Go to [ID Crawl](https://www.idcrawl.com/).
2.  Enter the **username, email, phone number, or full name**.
3.  Review the results — this may include **social media profiles, blogs, and forum accounts**.
4.  Note all linked accounts and verify them using other OSINT tools.

*Pro Tip:* Try multiple variations of the username — add/remove numbers, change underscores, try different capitalizations.
