### 4. Image OSINT – Geo Location Tracking

### Finding Where a Photo Was Taken

Always attempt to determine **where an image was captured** using context clues, AI tools, or metadata.

### Using AI for Geolocation

**[GeoSpy](https://geospy.ai/)** is an AI-powered tool that can estimate where a picture was taken.

It analyzes:

* Landmarks
* Vegetation
* Building styles

### Metadata Analysis

**Metadata** = extra information stored inside images, videos, or documents.

**Common Metadata Fields:**

* Creation and modification dates
* Author or username
* GPS coordinates (location where the photo was taken)
* Device information (camera/phone model, software)

**Note:**

* Platforms like **Instagram** and **Facebook** strip (remove) metadata from uploaded photos.
* Some websites do not remove metadata, so files may still contain GPS or device info.

**Tools:**

* [Metadata2Go](https://www.metadata2go.com/)

**Extensions:**

* [EXIF Viewer (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/exif-viewer/)
