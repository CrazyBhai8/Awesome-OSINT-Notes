# 7. Email OSINT

### **2.1 Finding Email Addresses**

#### **1. Uncovering Emails from Social / Online Accounts**

* Check if the target has publicly shared their email on social media profiles or websites.
* Visit all found accounts and manually look for email addresses (e.g., in bio, ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section, contact info).

#### **2. Using Search Operators**

* Use search engines to find publicly indexed email addresses.
  **Example query:**

```
"target name" "@hotmail.com" OR "@gmail.com" OR "@yahoo.com"
```

* Replace `"target name"` with their full name, username, or alias.

#### **3. Guessing Possible Email Addresses**

* Use **collected usernames** from the target‚Äôs profiles to create possible email combinations:

```
Collected usernames:
  user_name
  username420
  U.name
```

* Possible email guesses:

```
user_name@gmail.com
username420@yahoo.com
u.name@hotmail.com
```

#### **4. Validating Emails**

* Use an **email verification tool** like:
  üîó [https://www.experte.com/email-finder](https://www.experte.com/email-finder)

  * Enter the guessed or found email.
  * Check if it‚Äôs **valid**.

#### **5. Confirming Ownership**

* If valid, verify if it belongs to the target:

  * Use **‚ÄúForgot Password‚Äù** feature on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.
  * Observe partial recovery info shown (phone digits, linked email).

  * Send a **test email** (without suspicious content) and check the display name in the reply or ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù field.

#### **2.1.1 Creating and Verifying Possible Email Addresses**

* Generate a list of possible email combinations using the target‚Äôs name, username, or known aliases.
  **Example:**

```

* Use [Email Permutator](http://metricsparrow.com/toolkit/email-permutator/) to automatically generate all possible email variations.
* To verify:

  1. Paste all generated emails in the **To:** field of your email client to check for valid formatting.
